where I performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the iconic Titanic dataset. Leveraging powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I visualized the data to uncover intriguing patterns and insights.
🔍 Project Highlights:
Data Manipulation and Analysis: Efficiently handled using Pandas.
Bar Plots: Showcased survival rates across different passenger classes and genders.
Heatmaps: Visualized correlations between various features.
Scatter Plots: Explored relationships between age, fare, and survival probability.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensured accuracy in analysis through thorough data cleaning.
📊 Key Insights:
Higher survival rates among female passengers and those in first class.
Strong correlation between passenger class and survival chances.
Age and fare exhibit significant patterns affecting survival likelihood.
🚀 This project has not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also provided deeper insights into data visualization techniques and the importance of storytelling with data.
